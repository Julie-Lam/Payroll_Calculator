# Payroll_Calculator
A console application that accepts a CSV file of employee details including their Employee ID, Hours worked, Rate, and Visa number. 
The application distinguishes each unique employee (based on their employee ID), and calculates the Gross wage, Net wage, and Tax amount. The calculation of Tax and the resulting 
amount varies depending on whether the employee has a Visa number. 
The results of these calculations are written onto a CSV file located in: 
MyPaySolution > MyPayProject > bin > Debug > netcoreapp3.1 > Export 


The incoming CSV file is located at MyPaySolution > MyPayProject > bin > Debug > netcoreapp3.1 > Import
